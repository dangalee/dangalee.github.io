Computer architecure for what?
- Fundamentally Secure/Reliable/Safe Architectures
- Fundamentally Energy-efficient Architectures: memory-centric(Data-centric) Architectures
- Fundamentally Low-Latency and Predictable Architectures
- Architectures for AI/ML, Genomics, Medicine, Health

*Low-Latency: a computer network that is optimized to process a very high volume of data messages with minimal delay. 많은 양의 데이터를 최소한의 딜레이로 처리하는 컴퓨터 네트워크
