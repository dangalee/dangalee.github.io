### My story

After my internship as an AI chat-bot assistant at Amway Korea, in collaboration with the IT company KakaoTalk, I discovered a strong passion for the technology field. This realization led me to choose Computer Science as my major. Over the course of three years as a Computer Science student, I have honed my ability to think creatively and developed a keen attention to detail to prevent errors. I am deeply committed to my work and actively seek opportunities to contribute to the  organizations I am involved with.
