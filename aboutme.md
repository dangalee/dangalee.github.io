### My story

After working as an AI chat-bot assistant intern at Amway Korea with cooperating IT company KakaoTalk, I found my strong interest in the technology field. Therefore, I decided to major in Computer Science. After spending 3 years as a Computer Science student, I have learned how to think creatively about solutions and focus on small details to prevent errors from edge-cases. With my dedication to my work, I desire to provide internal technical improvement to the organization that I work for.
